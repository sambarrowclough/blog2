[**Content creators and celebrities have distribution that most companies do not, what can you build for them...**](https://www.notion.so/Content-creators-and-celebrities-have-distribution-that-most-companies-do-not-what-can-you-build-fo-b9f7c81bf6e44138805bb67e217935e8) is a great question to ask. Paul Grahams version of this would be what problems can you solve for them?

[artists are using Patreon as a means to generate income from virtual services](https://www.notion.so/artists-are-using-Patreon-as-a-means-to-generate-income-from-virtual-services-8461888c85c64cc2a02492c56e6b2efd), but their pricing and features are disjointed. A quick look at their subscription levels show there are a lot of common features they all provide:

- discounts
    - merch
    - tours
- access
    - private discord channels
    - private IG account
    - limited/exclusive merch
    - early access to tours
    - livestreams production/mixing sessions
    - unreleased music
    - behind the scenes videos/photos

What if instead of having these disjointed features, there was a holistic tool to cover the main bases? ( [[creator economy tools] provide holistic tools to grow and operate a business](https://www.notion.so/creator-economy-tools-provide-holistic-tools-to-grow-and-operate-a-business-855d89985ed047cfa95ef72dcfebb411)). The features mentioned are proof that something is working manually ( [Don't automate until you are doing something that works manually](https://www.notion.so/Don-t-automate-until-you-are-doing-something-that-works-manually-19722143cb474921b655414ef0dcd54f)). So joining the most common ones into a tool for a better experience would be the obvious next step.
