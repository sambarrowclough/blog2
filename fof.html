	<h1>Forks out of Frustration</h1>
	<span>17 January, 2020</span>
	<p>When products are created because makers are not happy with the current lineup.</p>
	<p>Some examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Dropbox - "the problem is that the user experience (on windows at least) with online drives generally sucks" - Drew Houston, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863">My YC app: Dropbox - Throw away your USB drive</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Google - wasn't the first search engine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine">it was the 24th</>
		</li>
		<li>
			Facebook - was not the first social media platform - certainly was the last
		</li>
	</ul>
