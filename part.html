Paul Grahams version of this would be what problems can you solve for them?</p>

A quick look at their subscription levels show there are a lot of common features they all provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>discounts
<ul>
<li>merch</li>
<li>tours</li>
</ul></li>
<li>access
<ul>
<li>private discord channels</li>
<li>private IG account</li>
<li>limited/exclusive merch</li>
<li>early access to tours</li>
<li>livestreams production/mixing sessions</li>
<li>unreleased music</li>
<li>behind the scenes videos/photos</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What if instead of having these disjointed features, there was a holistic tool to cover the main bases? ( <a href="https://www.notion.so/creator-economy-tools-provide-holistic-tools-to-grow-and-operate-a-business-855d89985ed047cfa95ef72dcfebb411">[creator economy tools] provide holistic tools to grow and operate a business</a>). The features mentioned are proof that something is working manually ( <a href="https://www.notion.so/Don-t-automate-until-you-are-doing-something-that-works-manually-19722143cb474921b655414ef0dcd54f">Don’t automate until you are doing something that works manually</a>). So joining the most common ones into a tool for a better experience would be the obvious next step.</p>
